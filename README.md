## About The Project

![](screenshot.jpg)

Get ready for a spooktacular Halloween movie night with our horror movie advisor! üßü‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Just open the app, and it will suggest a scary movie for you. If you're not thrilled with the first choice, click "Try again" for a new recommendation.

You can also explore more details about the suggested movie by clicking on an IMDb rating button to access the IMDb page.

The app defaults to all-time high-rated movies. If you're feeling adventurous, click "Show filters" to access a variety of options for specifying the era and rating of the movie. But beware, the filters are quite opinionated üòú
